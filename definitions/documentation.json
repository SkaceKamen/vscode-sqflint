Feature !! Description !! Since\n!-\n! \"all\" !! Disables all features. !! \n!-\n! \"AIMINGERROR\" !! Prevents AI's aiming from being distracted by its shooting, moving, turning, reloading, hit, injury, fatigue, suppression or concealed / lost target. !! \n!-\n! \"ANIM\" !! Disables all animations of the unit. Completely freezes the unit, including breathing and blinking. No move command works until the unit is unfrozen. !! \n!-\n! \"AUTOCOMBAT\" !! Disables autonomous switching to \"COMBAT\" AI Behaviour when in danger. !! \n!-\n! \"AUTOTARGET\" !! Essentially makes single units without a group \"deaf\". The unit still goes prone and combat ready if it hears gunfire. It will not turn around when gunfire comes from behind, but if an enemy walks in front of it it will target the enemy and fire as normal. Does not work for grouped units as the leader will assign targets to the units, effectively reenabling this feature. !! -\n!-\n! \"CHECKVISIBLE\" !! Disables visibility raycasts. Useful in PvP missions where these raycasts are not needed. !! \n!-\n! \"COVER\" !! Disables usage of cover positions by the AI. !! \n!-\n! \"FSM\" !! Example  Disables the attached FSM scripts which are responsible for the AI behaviour. Enemies react slower to enemy fire and the enemy stops using hand signals. Disabling FSM can give the impression of untrained units as they react slower and are more disorganized compared to when FSM is enabled. !! \n!-\n! \"LIGHTS\" !! Stops AI from operating vehicle headlights and collision lights. !! \n!-\n! \"MINEDETECTION\" !! Disable AI's mine detection. !! \n!-\n! \"MOVE\" !! This will stop units from turning and moving, including vehicles. Units will still change stance and fire at the enemy if the enemy happens to walk right in front of the barrel. Units will watch enemies that are in their line of sight, but will not turn their bodies to face the enemy, only their head. Works for grouped units as well. Good for staging units and holding them completely still. Movement can not be controlled via script either, this feature has to be reenabled for that. The unit will still be able to aim within its cone of fire. !! -\n!-\n! \"NVG\" !! Stops AI from putting on NVGs (but not from taking them off). !! \n!-\n! \"PATH\" !! Stops the AI's movement but not the target alignment. !! \n!-\n! \"RADIOPROTOCOL\" !! Stops AI from talking and texting while still being able to issue orders. !! \n!-\n! \"SUPPRESSION\" !! Prevents AI from being suppressed. See Arma 3: Suppression. !! \n!-\n! \"TARGET\" !! Prevents units from engaging targets. Units still move around for cover, but will not hunt down enemies. Works in groups as well. Excellent for keeping units inside bases or other areas without having them flank or engage anyone. They will still seek good cover if something is close by. !! -\n!-\n! \"TEAMSWITCH\" !! This will disable AI unit when teamswitching. !! -\n!-\n! \"WEAPONAIM\" !! Disables weapon aiming. !! -\n!}\n</spoiler>"}],"returns":{"type":"Nothing"}}],"compatibility":[{"game":"ofp","version":"1.00"},{"game":"ofpe","version":"1.00"},{"game":"arma1","version":"1.00"},{"game":"arma2","version":"1.00"},{"game":"arma2oa","version":"1.50"},{"game":"tkoh","version":"1.00"},{"game":"arma3","version":"0.50"}],"source":"core"},"disableuserinput":{"title":"disableUserInput","type":"command","description":"Disables or enables the keyboard and mouse input.

For example if the file is 'myExtension.dll' the name of the extension will be \"myExtension\". For 64-bit extensions, the name of the extension doesn't need to change and is still \"myExtension\". The game will automatically look for 'myExtension_x64.dll' when you use 64-bit Arma exe.\n\nThis command is blocking, meaning that the game will wait for the extension to return before continuing. This may cause FPS drop if extension is not optimised. If extension takes too long, consider making asynchronous extension, where the result of the work of the extension is collected in a separate call.\n\nCurrently there is no limit how much data you can send to the extension. However there is a limit on how much data you can return from extension in one call. The limit is known to the extension and is passed in . The limit may or may not change in the future and is currently 10240 bytes. It is up to extension designer to handle multipart results if returned data exceeds output limit.\n\nSince Arma 3 v1.67 it is possible to pass array of arguments to extensions. The array of arguments could be anything and all elements will be converted to strings, however you might want to only send simple types like Booleans, Strings, Numbers and Arrays of all of the above. There is currently a limit on how many arguments can be sent and it is 2048 (since Arma 3 v1.92; previous limit: 1024). However an argument could be an Array itself, in this case extension maker will have to provide additional methods for parsing such arguments.\n\nPossible error codes:\n* 101: SYNTAX_ERROR_WRONG_PARAMS_SIZE\n* 102: SYNTAX_ERROR_WRONG_PARAMS_TYPE\n* 201: PARAMS_ERROR_TOO_MANY_ARGS\n* 301: EXECUTION_WARNING_TAKES_TOO_LONG\nEach error will have entry in .rpt file with more details.\n\nThe extension execution timeout, after which  warning is issued, is hardcoded on clients and is 1000.0 milliseconds (1 second). On the server the default limit is also 1 second, however it is possible to set custom limit with  param (see  Server Options).\n\nIf an extension with the given name can't be found (or it is found but doesn't implement the required interface properly / at all) the following error will be written into the RPT (In this example the given dll-name was \"MyExtension\"):\n styledisplay: block14:27:07 CallExtension 'MyExtension' could not be found\n\nIf an extension is not whitelisted with BattlEye (see Extensions for more info) it will be blocked on clients running with enabled BattlEye protection. RPT message outputted however is a little obscure:\n styledisplay: block21:35:04 Call extension 'MyExtension' could not be loaded: Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service\n\nSince Arma 3 v1.69,  interface (see source code example below) has been added, which is called by the engine on extension load and expects extension version. This interface is designed to work with both, Linux and Windows. The max buffer size is 32 bytes. The version information will then appear in .rpt file like so:\n styledisplay: block19:06:36 CallExtension loaded: test_extension (.\\test_extension.dll) [1.0.0.1]\n\nFor more information see Extensions.\n\nLinux specific\nWhile on Windows the extension name is case-insensitive, on Linux the extension name is case-sensitive and should match the name of the .so file exactly (minus \".so\" part).\n\n\n\n\nExtension Callback\n\nSince Arma 3 v1.95 it is possible to call the game directly from the extension via function pointer provided when extension is called for the first time (assuming the extension implements at least one of the  or  methods). The function pointer passed over to  method is of the following signature (see Example 4):\n langcppint(*callbackProc)(char const *name, char const *function, char const *data)\nCalling this function pointer from extension will trigger  \"ExtensionCallback\" mission event handler with 3 user supplied params. The params are\n*  - make it unique name, for example the extension name, so that other modders can quickly filter out calls from own extensions\n*  - make it name of the function the extension sends the result to. (Note: The returned function is just a STRING! So compile is needed, before using call or spawn, to execute it)\n*  - make it the actual result. You can also format it as an array so it could be parsed by parseSimpleArray\nCalling function pointer returns an . This is the number of available slots in the input buffer left for this frame after your call and can range from 99 to -1. The buffer is processed and cleared every frame and the maximum number of slots that can be filled per frame is 100. If you are planning to call back with more than 100 results per frame, make sure your extension retries if it receives negative , which means the buffer was full and your call did not succeed. Ideally suited for callbacks from different threads, but if callback is initiated from the calling thread, the EH will fire on the next frame of game simulation. Needless to say, the \"ExtensionCallback\" event handler needs to exist before any callbacks, otherwise the data will just stay in the buffer. Removing all \"ExtensionCallback\" EHs clears the buffer as well as mission restart.\n\nExtension Context\n\nSince Arma 3 v2.11 the engine will call  method (if exists, see Example 5) and pass the following data:\n*  of the client calling extension getPlayerUID or \"0\"\n*  from which the extension was executed or \"\" if done on the fly\n*  missionNameSource\n*  serverName","syntaxes":[{"code":"extension callExtension function","args":[{"name":"extension","type":"String","desc":"extension name"},{"name":"function","type":"String","desc":"data sent to the extension"}],"returns":{"type":"String","desc":"data sent back from extension; If the extensiion was not found an empty String will be returned"}},{"code":"extension callExtension  [function, arguments]","args":[{"name":"extension","type":"String","desc":"extension name"},{"name":"function","type":"String","desc":"extension function identifier"},{"name":"arguments","type":"Array","desc":"function arguments.
